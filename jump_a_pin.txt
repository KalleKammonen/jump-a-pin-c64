Jump-A-Pin
**********
Jump-A-Pin is a 2 player board game where the goal is to collect as many pins as possible.
The player with the most pins (points) wins the game.

You collect a pin by taking one pin and then jump over another pin into a hole in the board.
The hole needs to be right after the pin that you are jumping over.
Jumps can be made in all eight directions.
The pin that you jumped over is removed from the board and you recieve one point.
Multiple jumps are possible in one turn.

Keys:
A: Left
D: Right
S: Down
E: Up
1: Jump From - Player 1
2: Jump From - Player 2
T: Jump To (execute jump)

A jump is done this way:
The player moves to the pin to jump from with the direction keys.
Press either 1 or 2, depending on which player, to select which pin to jump with.
Navigate to the hole to jump to and press T.
If the player can jump more than once in the turn, just repeat the procedure.

When it's the other players turn, the other player just navigates to the desired pin
and does the procedure for jumping with either button 1 or 2.
